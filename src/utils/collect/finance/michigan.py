"""This module provides functions to scrape Michigan campaign finance data.

Data is retireved form the Legacy Downloads provided by the Michigan Secretary of State.
It is accessed from the following URL:
https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/disclosure/cfr/committee-search/intro/welcome-to-the-michigan-campaign-finance-searchable-database

For full historical data, you can search here:
https://mi-boe.entellitrak.com/etk-mi-boe-prod/page.request.do?page=page.miboeContributionPublicSearch.

This has known issues and does not allow for large downloads at this time. Michigan SOS
is working on it with status being updated here:
https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/disclosure/mitn-information

Previously data was available here:
https://miboecfr.nictusa.com/cfr/dumpall/cfrdetail/

This is no longer available without a login.
